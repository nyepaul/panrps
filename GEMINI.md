## Project: Retirement & Wealth Planning System (RPS)

**Type**: Web Application (Flask/Vanilla JS)
**Version**: 3.9.x (See `src/__version__.py`)
**Location**: `/home/paul/src/rps`
**Manager**: `bin/manage` (Main CLI entry point)

## Overview

RPS is a comprehensive, **local-first** financial planning application designed for high-fidelity retirement modeling. It combines a rigorous Monte Carlo simulation engine with optional AI capabilities to provide professional-grade financial analysis while maintaining complete data privacy.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Financial Modeling Engine (`src/services/retirement_model.py`)
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: High-performance, vectorized simulation (10,000 runs) projecting success rates over 30+ years.
- **Tax Engine**: Detailed US tax modeling including:
  - Progressive Federal Income Tax (MFJ/Single).
  - Social Security taxability logic.
  - Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) stacking.
  - Medicare IRMAA surcharges.
  - 10% Early Withdrawal Penalties.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**:
  - **Standard**: Conventional drawdown.
  - **Retirement Smile**: Higher spending in early retirement, decreasing later.
  - **Conservative Decline**: Gradual spending reduction.
- **Dynamic Income**: Models complex streams like Social Security (with claiming age optimization), Pensions (Lump vs. Stream), and Budget-based income.

### 2. AI Integration (Optional) (`src/services/ai_service.py`)
The system works fully offline but gains capabilities with API keys (Gemini/Claude):
- **AI Advisor**: Context-aware chat for personalized financial strategy.
- **Asset Extraction**: **Computer Vision** feature to extract account details (holdings, values) from uploaded statement images/screenshots.
- **Action Items**: AI-generated, prioritized task lists based on profile analysis.

### 3. Reporting & Analysis
- **Elite PDF Reports**: Professional-grade PDF generation with charts and detailed analysis (`src/services/pdf_service_elite.py`).
- **User Activity Reports**: Admin-facing analytics on user engagement and feature usage.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive Chart.js dashboards for wealth projection and tax bracket management.

### 4. Security & Data
- **Local-First**: All data stored in SQLite (`data/planning.db`).
- **Encryption**: Profile data encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM (`src/services/encryption_service.py`).
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging with **IP Geolocation** tracking (`docs/GEOLOCATION_LOGGING.md`).
- **Data Portability**: Full CSV Import/Export capabilities for assets.

### 5. Educational Content
- **Skills System**: Built-in knowledge base (`skills/`) serving markdown guides on topics like "Tax Strategy" and "Estate Planning" (`src/routes/skills.py`).

## System Architecture

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Flask.
  - **No ORM**: Uses raw SQL with parameterized queries for performance and explicit control.
  - **Stateless Logic**: Calculations are performed on-the-fly based on current profile state.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules).
  - **Component-based**: Organized in `src/static/js/components/`.
  - **No Bundler**: Files served directly to the browser.
- **Database**: SQLite with Alembic for migrations (`migrations/`).
